# A Sudoku solver

Wrote this recursive solver a several years ago. It appears to solve this: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/9359579/Worlds-hardest-sudoku-can-you-crack-it.html

That's paywalled, of course, but I did find this solution: https://www.magicwordsquare.us/2012/06/ which appears to match.

There must be so many programs like this ...
